License Agreement

THIS SOFTWARE IS LICENSED, NOT SOLD. YOU MAY USE THIS SOFTWARE ONLY AS DESCRIBED IN THIS AGREEMENT.

As part of the installation process, you will be asked to accept the terms of this Agreement. This agreement is a legal agreement between you and e.World Technology Limited ("e.World"). You should carefully read the following terms and conditions before installing or using the software. Installation or use of the software indicates your agreement to be bound by these terms and conditions.

Software

The capitalized term "Software" refers to the object code for the computer program known as PHPMaker, any updates, supplemental code or programs provided to you by e.World with or in connection with PHPMaker, the user's manual and Help file, any components, any related media and printed materials, and any related "online" or electronic documentation.

Evaluation License

If you acquired the license for the Software on an evaluation or trial basis, you may use the Software without charge for the evaluation period of 30 days. Your evaluation period begins on the day you install the Software. You must pay the license fee and register your copy to continue to use the Software after the evaluation period. To pay the license fee and register your copy, you should visit www.hkvstore.com.

Registered License

When you purchase a license, you will be provided with a license key. You must enable the registered license for the Software by entering the license key as prompted by the Software. The term of the license is perpetual unless you purchased a limited term license. A single registered Software may either be used by a single person who uses the software himself on one or more computers, or installed on a single computer and used by multiple people, but not both. You may access the registered Software through a network, provided that you have obtained individual licenses for the software covering all computers that will run the software from the network, whether or not they use the registered Software at different times or concurrently.

Generated Source Code

When you use the Software under a registered license, you are granted a non-exclusive right to use, modify, and redistribute the source code ("Code") generated by the registered Software provided that you: (a) distribute the Code only for the sole purpose of executing web applications that you have created; (b) do not use any part of the Code to build any other code generators for public distribution or commercial sale. AT NO TIME MAY YOU CREATE ANY TOOL(S) OR SOFTWARE(S) THAT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY COMPETES WITH THE SOFTWARE WHICH UTILIZES ALL OR ANY PORTION OF CODE GENERATED BY THE SOFTWARE. You MAY NOT REDISTRIBUTE any Code if using the evaluation, trial or demo version of the Software.

Restrictions

You may not reduce the Software to human readable form, reverse engineer, de-compile, disassemble, merge, adapt, or modify the Software, except and only to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law notwithstanding this limitation. You may not rent, lease, or lend the Software.

Distribution

Provided that you are distributing the most current version of non-registered Software, you may give exact copies of the evaluation Software to anyone. You may not charge any fee for the copy or use of the evaluation Software itself, but you may charge a distribution fee that is reasonably related to any cost you incur distributing the evaluation Software (e.g. packaging). You must not represent in any way that you are selling the Software itself. Your distribution of the evaluation Software will not entitle you to any compensation from e.World. You must distribute a copy of this license with any copy of the Software and anyone to whom you distribute the Software is subject to this license. You may not remove any copyright, trademark or reservation of rights language displayed on, in or with the Software.

Termination

This license terminates if you fail to comply with its terms and conditions. If your license terminates, you must destroy all copies of the Software. The termination of this license does not limit e.World's other rights it may have by law.

Intellectual Property

You acknowledge that you have only the limited, non-exclusive right to use and copy the Software as expressly stated in this license and that e.World retains title to the Software and all other rights not expressly granted. You agree not to remove or modify any copyright, trademark, patent or other proprietary notices that appear, on, in or with the Software. The Software is protected by Hong Kong copyright, patent and trademark laws and international treaty provisions.

NO WARRANTIES

TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE SOFTWARE AND ANY SUPPORT SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT. IF APPLICABLE LAW REQUIRES A WARRANTY, THE REQUIRED WARRANTY IS LIMITED TO NINETY (90) DAYS FROM YOUR RECEIPT OF A COPY OF THE SOFTWARE. COMPUTER PROGRAMS ARE INHERENTLY COMPLEX, AND THE SOFTWARE MAY NOT BE FREE OF ERRORS. THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED WITH ALL FAULTS AND THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO SATISFACTORY QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, ACCURACY AND EFFORT IS WITH YOU.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

E.WORLD IS NOT LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF THE DELIVERY, PERFORMANCE, OR USE OF THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF E.WORLD HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. UNLESS APPLICABLE LAW PROVIDES OTHERWISE, E.WORLD'S LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM RELATED TO YOUR PURCHASE OF A LICENSE FOR OR USE OF THE SOFTWARE, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF U.S. $5.00 OR THE LICENSE FEE PAID BY YOU.
